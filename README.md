# bloom

An implementation of bloom filters in rust.

# Basic Usage

```rust
extern crate bloom;
use bloom::BloomFilter;
let expected_num_items = 1000;
let false_positive_rate = 0.01;
let mut filter:BloomFilter = BloomFilter::with_rate(false_positive_rate,expected_num_items);
filter.insert(&1i);
filter.contains(&1i); /* true */
filter.contains(&2i); /* false */
```

# Installation
Use [Cargo](http://doc.crates.io/) and add the following to your Cargo.toml

```
[dependencies]
bloom="0.2.0"
```

# False Positive Rate
The false positive rate is specified as a float in the range
(0,1).  If indicates that out of `X` probes, `X * rate` should
return a false positive.  Higher values will lead to smaller (but
more inaccurate) filters.

# Benchmarks
This crate includes some benchmarks to test the performance of the
bloom filter.  To run them you'll need to use rust nightly (the
benchmark feature isn't stable yet), and then run:

```
cargo bench --features "do-bench"
```
